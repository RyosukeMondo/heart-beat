# Competitive Heart-Beat Gaming - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Competitive Heart-Beat Gaming feature transforms the existing heart rate monitoring application into a social, competitive platform where users can challenge each other through heart rate-based games. This feature adds user authentication, real-time multiplayer functionality, and various gaming modes that test different aspects of cardiovascular fitness including 瞬発力 (instant response), resilience, and endurance.

The feature enables users to login, share their current heart-beat data, participate in multiplayer sessions where players can monitor each other's heart rates, and compete in various game categories with clear win/lose conditions based on heart rate value changes.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature significantly expands the Heart Beat application's scope from individual fitness monitoring to a comprehensive competitive fitness platform, aligning with the product vision's Phase 3 roadmap item for "Social features and sharing." It maintains the core value proposition of "Real-time Monitoring" while adding competitive elements that enhance user engagement and motivation through gamification.

The competitive gaming element addresses the target audience expansion from individual "Fitness Enthusiasts" to include competitive athletes and social fitness communities, while preserving the scientific training principles and cross-platform compatibility that define the application's technical foundation.

4. WHEN a player leaves during a session THEN the system SHALL notify other participants and handle the disconnection gracefully
5. WHEN the session host leaves THEN the system SHALL either transfer hosting to another player or end the session

### Requirement 4: 瞬発力 (Instant Response) Game Category

**User Story:** As a competitive player, I want to participate in instant response challenges, so that I can test and improve my cardiovascular reactivity against other players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a 瞬発力 game starts THEN the system SHALL present synchronized stimuli to all players and measure heart rate response speed
2. WHEN a player's heart rate increases fastest after stimulus THEN the system SHALL award points for that round
3. WHEN the game consists of multiple rounds THEN the system SHALL track cumulative scores and display leaderboards
4. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL declare the winner based on total response speed points
5. WHEN heart rate change is below threshold THEN the system SHALL not award points for that stimulus

### Requirement 5: Resilience Game Category

**User Story:** As a competitive player, I want to participate in resilience challenges, so that I can test my ability to maintain stable heart rate under varying conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a resilience game starts THEN the system SHALL present stress-inducing challenges while monitoring heart rate stability
2. WHEN a player maintains heart rate within specified zones THEN the system SHALL award stability points
3. WHEN heart rate variability exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL deduct points for instability
4. WHEN the challenge duration completes THEN the system SHALL determine winner based on cumulative stability scores
5. WHEN multiple stress phases occur THEN the system SHALL weight different phases according to difficulty

### Requirement 6: Endurance Game Category

**User Story:** As a competitive player, I want to participate in endurance challenges, so that I can test my cardiovascular stamina against other players over extended periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an endurance game starts THEN the system SHALL monitor sustained heart rate performance over extended duration
2. WHEN a player maintains target heart rate zones THEN the system SHALL award endurance points continuously
3. WHEN a player's heart rate drops below minimum threshold THEN the system SHALL begin point deduction or elimination countdown
4. WHEN the endurance period completes THEN the system SHALL rank players based on total time in target zones
5. WHEN a player is eliminated THEN the system SHALL continue the game with remaining participants

### Requirement 7: Game Session Controls

**User Story:** As a session host, I want to start and stop games with clear controls, so that I can manage the competitive experience for all participants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a host selects a game type THEN the system SHALL display game rules and allow configuration of parameters
2. WHEN the host starts a game THEN the system SHALL provide synchronized countdown and begin monitoring for all players
3. WHEN the host stops a game THEN the system SHALL immediately end the current round and display results
4. WHEN a game is in progress THEN the system SHALL display elapsed time and current standings to all players
5. WHEN emergency stop is triggered THEN the system SHALL immediately halt all game activities and return to lobby

### Requirement 8: Win/Lose Determination and Results

**User Story:** As a competitive player, I want clear win/lose results based on heart-beat value changes, so that I can understand my performance and improve in future games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game completes THEN the system SHALL calculate final scores based on heart rate performance metrics
2. WHEN results are determined THEN the system SHALL display winner, rankings, and individual performance statistics
3. WHEN heart rate data shows clear performance differences THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analysis of winning factors

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component (authentication, game logic, networking, UI) should be isolated with clear interfaces
- **Modular Design**: Game categories should be implemented as pluggable modules with shared base classes
- **Dependency Management**: Networking layer should be abstracted to support different backend implementations
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined contracts between game engine, networking, and UI layers

### Performance

- **Real-time Data Transmission**: Heart rate data must be transmitted with < 500ms latency between players
- **Simultaneous Users**: System must support at least 8 concurrent players per session

- **Connection Handling**: Automatic reconnection within 5 seconds for temporary network issues

### Security

- **Authentication Security**: Secure password storage using industry-standard hashing
- **Data Transmission**: All heart rate and game data must be transmitted over encrypted connections
- **Session Security**: Game sessions must be protected against unauthorized joining or data manipulation
- **Privacy Controls**: Users must have granular control over what heart rate data is shared

### Reliability

- **Connection Resilience**: Games must handle player disconnections gracefully without ending sessions
- **Data Integrity**: Heart rate data must be validated for accuracy and prevent cheating
- **Error Recovery**: System must recover from network errors without losing game progress
